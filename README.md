# Microsoft Movie Madness

**Author**: Joshua Allen

## Overview

Microsoft is looking to make its first foray into the movie studio business is looking for recommendations as to what it should consider as it decides what type of movie to make for its first feature length film.  We have analyzed data from a variety of industry sources ([IMDB](https://www.imdb.com), [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/), and [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)) by comparing genres for profitibility and return on investment, runtime against profitibility and how the chosen month of release for a movie can impact profitability.  In the end, it is recommended that Microsoft create an **animated movie** with a runtime of around **90-100 minutes** and a budget of approximately **87 million USD**.  The recommended months for release are the summer months of **May, June, and July.**
